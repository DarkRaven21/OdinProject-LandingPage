# OdinProject-LandingPage
A Landing Page made from scratch just by looking at the finished product

In this project I will try to recreate a Web Page only by seeing the finished product. I will not inspect the page to peek at the code, I will only see the layout of the page and from that I will try to make a Html document from scratch, style it with css and hope that my page and the previously looked page will look the same.
